            <p>Eye Guy's DNA was sampled from an Opticoid, a reptilian race with 17 eyes across their body. Though none are
                on their face.
                <p>

                    Butt-Monkey: Omniverse frequently puts him in places where his multiple eyes does more harm than good (such as getting drenched
                    in an eye irritant alien's saliva). Chest Blaster: His strongest beam comes from a giant eye in his torso.
                    He usually has to close the others to fire it. Creepy Good: Half-bat, half-reptile, and eyes all over
                    its body. So much creepy, actually, that he was almost rejected by production because of it. Early-Bird
                    Cameo: Appeared for the first time in an alternate scene of Secret of the Omnitrix's opening scene but
                    chronologically appeared first in "Ben 10 vs. The Negative 10, Part 2". Exactly What It Says on the Tin:
                    Amusingly, he's the only alien for which Ben and Ben 23 share the same name, which leads to Ben admitting
                    that the name is lame. Extra Eyes: Has eyes everywhere...
                    <p> Eyes Do Not Belong There: Except where they should be. Eyeless Face: The only place on his body without
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>Eye Beams: Every eye can fire a laser beam. Some eyes have a different type of laser.</p>
